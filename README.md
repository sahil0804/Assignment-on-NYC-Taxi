This file contains the analysis of CO2 emissions in NYC taxi Limousine comission. The file contain code chunks. The first chunk basically shows the loading of the data from NYC official site. When we click on run the data of 12 months loads in to the workspace. The next chunk prints the structure of the data so that we can make a decision so as to how can we analyse it. The next chunk is where the CO2 emissions are compared to the distance travelled and the fuel consumed by the taxis which depicts some numbers showing there is a linear relationship between emissions and distance travlled. The next chunk prints the schema which again shows the strucure of data. Next 2 chunks focus on the number of passangers travelling and CO2 emissions which may show that are the CO2 emissions increasing or decreasing becuase of the change in number of passangers. The next chunk we plot these into a graph so as to have a visual representation of the numbers. Lets run them and see what is the solution we get.
